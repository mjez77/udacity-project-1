        <p class="post-txt">Macrame has helped me to deal with the stress and pressure caused by pandemic.<br><br>
          I did lose my job last year and my self-esteem suffered. Many members of my family and friends got the virus
          and some even lost the fight with it. It has been a very difficult time for me on a personal level. I have not
          been directly affected by the virus, but it has had its influence on my mental health. My freedom was
          restricted. I couldn't go out when I wanted, and I couldn't go where I wanted. At times it was depression,
          other times it was anxiety as fear and uncertainty ruled over my mind. I know that without macrame things
          would have been worst.<br><br>
          Looking on the bright side of things, my macrame craft really thrived last year. I had more free time to learn
          and practice the craft.<br><br>
          I also noticed that, when I was knotting, I was being transported away from tensions and confusions of
          everyday life. There was just me and my work. Paying more attention to the present moment - does it sound
          familiar? I was practicing mindfulness.<br><br>
          Crafting requires full focus and concentration. Creating macrame pieces, did not only disconnect me from the
          world around, but helped me to observe my thoughts and feelings and better understand myself. In result it was
          calming me down and making me happy.<br><br>
          Completing entire macrame projects would give me a great sense of accomplishment and it would also be a form
          of expression of my inner feelings, the ones I was not comfortable to talk about.</p>

        <p>Hi, my name is Joanna.<br>
          I'm a Macramé artist based in London, Uk. I specialise in macramé home décor: wall hangings, garlands,
          cosaters, curtains, plant hangers and whatever my imagination conceive.
          <br><br>
          I believe that the creating process involves two persons. When I make something, I leave a part of myself in
          it. Your orders are always made with intention an purpose to make you - my client happy.<br>
          I think of you during making process, with every inch of the cotton cord that flows through my fingers.
          Therefore, in each final product, both of us are reflected: me - the maker and you - the person ordering.
